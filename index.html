						program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
						never
						had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
						took
						my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often
						referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
						helped
						me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
